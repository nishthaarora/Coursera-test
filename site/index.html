			<h2> "I'm not your quintessential harmless nice guy": Sajan Raj Kurup.</h2> 
			<P>
				By his own admission, Sajan Raj Kurup, 40, is one of the 'most discussed' creative heads in the industry - and not always for the most flattering reasons. In a candid chat with afaqs!, the founder and creative chairman of Creativeland Asia, a nine-year-old advertising agency, talks about what makes him both popular and notorious.
				Creativeland Asia has 167 employees and its clientele comprises names like Mercedes, Micromax, BBlunt, Domino's, Indian Express, Benetton, Caf√© Coffee Day, Kalpataru and several brands from the Godrej stable.
				Edited Excerpts.	

				As Reliance Jio gears towards upgrading its ongoing trial run of the fourth-generation technology (4G) network into a commercial operation over the next few months, it says it already has at least half a million users.
				In an investor presentation, the company said, it "launched full scale service for RIL group employees, partners, vendors and associates on December 28 and over 500,000 users are on board". The launch is now being expanded to others, it said.
				Last month, it began a Reliance Jio employee referral program for its 4G service; each staffer could invite up to 10 friends to sign up. Initial feedback on the trial run was "very encouraging", it said.
				In the first month of the trial, average monthly data consumption was 18 GB and average monthly voice usage was a bit over 250 minutes, according to a presentation dated last Thursday.
				Jio is also testing its digital applications that are to come bundled with the connection. These include Jio Money, Jio Chat, Jio Drive, Jio Play and Jio News. The company's website, Jio.com, also went live on Thursday.
				A June 1 note by IDFC Securities, whose research team recently did a stress test on the RJio network in Mumbai, says, "Initial high usage by subscribers (18 GB/month) under the free trial period may not be the right benchmark." This is because the network experience could differ materially once the load increases, it added.
				"Nonetheless, better throughput (amount of data that can be moved successfully from one place to another in a given time period), with useful content at a reasonable price, could drive a 3-4x increase in data consumption from the current levels of 700-800 MB/month," it said.
				Reliance Jio Infocomm, subsidiary of Mukesh Ambani's Reliance Industries, has a pan-India 4G network coverage, claiming to be 80 times faster than rivals. Experts say its rates are likely to be as low as 0.5p for 10 KB of data and 5p per second for video calls. The base rate for local and STD calls is likely to be 2p a second.
				At present, Jio has 4G frequencies in the 1,800 and 2,300 MHz bands in 18 and 22 circles, respectively, and 800 MHz in 10 circles. It will have the 800 MHz band in all the 22 circles after completing its transaction with Reliance Communications, with which it has a trading and sharing pact, the presentation said.
				Jio says network rollout is substantially over and it is now in the process of receiving 800 MHz spectrum in more circles, to be integrated shortly thereafter. "Final approvals are anticipated for completion of trading and sharing arrangements with RCom for spectrum in the 800 MHz band," the company said, adding no other operator had deployed LTE in the sub-GHz band in the industry.


				The term 'USP', acronym for Unique Selling Proposition, insists the first-time author, died 30 years ago. The reason "old marketing" doesn't work today is because "consumers have caught on to the old tricks" he says in the book. Spruced with 'Guru Speak' sections (in which he liberally quotes experts like Nassim Nicholas Taleb and Malcolm Gladwell, among others), the book implores modern day marketers to reboot their mantras.
				Suman moved to Ulka last year. He finished writing the book a year before he moved to Ulka. Which means, the book, which is about the urgent need to do away with the old tenets of marketing, has little to do with the way Ulka's 'traditional' lot of clients, like Tata, Amul, Hero, ITC, Zee and Wipro, operate. We had to ask, though.
				In fact, the first draft of Marketing Unplugged was written in 2010, Suman tells us. Over the years, it kept changing shape. It reflects his experience working with a lot of "new sector clients" from technology, e-commerce, services, telecom, media and healthcare segments.
				"There are so many buzz words, so many 'hot books' of the year. As a planner, one is always trying to make a simpler story of the complex goings-on. This is my attempt at simplifying all the things around us - social, mobile, big data... how does all this fit? The exercise of sitting down and writing this helped me sort a lot of things in my own head," sighs Suman.
				The book has ten sections. "The pieces within these sections have been written as blog posts," he says, hoping the format will appeal to the younger generation. This is as close as he could come to "not sounding professorial," he smiles.</P>

			<h2> Girls in green lipstick, guys in bridal nose-rings: What's Jabong rebelling against? </h2>
			<p class="highlight">
			
			Anti-establishment symbols, sequinned faces, satiny turbans, and feathery eyelids - Jabong is trying hard to make a point in this new ad film. What might that be?I am not a match...I am not a catch...your mom won't call me suitable...
			You don't have to call me pretty...you don't get to call me ugly...you don't deserve my pity...I'm just me And, if you and your mom were listening to, or reading these lyrics, sans the video, which is a new ad for the online fashion portal Jabong, you will wonder what the fuss is about, or what is the brand rebelling against. Towards the end, the video tells us that the 'rebellion' is aimed at encouraging people to be what they are through the brand's tagline 'Be You'.

			<h2>"Old paradigms of marketing worked for FMCG": FCB Ulka's Suman Srivastava on his first book 'Marketing Unplugged'</h2>
			

			<p>
			Would you buy a car that was made in the 1960s? Then why do marketers still use outdated mantras to sell? That's the premise of Suman Srivastava's debut literary excursion Marketing Unplugged. That's also the name of the brand consultancy he launched after quitting his job as India CEO and APAC CSO at Euro RSCG, around five years back. The venture was recently made part of FCB Ulka Group, where Suman currently works as vice chairman and chief strategy officer.Marketing Unplugged book
			The term 'USP', acronym for Unique Selling Proposition, insists the first-time author, died 30 years ago. The reason "old marketing" doesn't work today is because "consumers have caught on to the old tricks" he says in the book. Spruced with 'Guru Speak' sections (in which he liberally quotes experts like Nassim Nicholas Taleb and Malcolm Gladwell, among others), the book implores modern day marketers to reboot their mantras.
			Suman moved to Ulka last year. He finished writing the book a year before he moved to Ulka. Which means, the book, which is about the urgent need to do away with the old tenets of marketing, has little to do with the way Ulka's 'traditional' lot of clients, like Tata, Amul, Hero, ITC, Zee and Wipro, operate. We had to ask, though.
			In fact, the first draft of Marketing Unplugged was written in 2010, Suman tells us. Over the years, it kept changing shape. It reflects his experience working with a lot of "new sector clients" from technology, e-commerce, services, telecom, media and healthcare segments.
			"There are so many buzz words, so many 'hot books' of the year. As a planner, one is always trying to make a simpler story of the complex goings-on. This is my attempt at simplifying all the things around us - social, mobile, big data... how does all this fit? The exercise of sitting down and writing this helped me sort a lot of things in my own head," sighs Suman.
			The book has ten sections. "The pieces within these sections have been written as blog posts," he says, hoping the format will appeal to the younger generation. This is as close as he could come to "not sounding professorial," he smiles.
			The book is targeted at "challenger brands with big ambitions." And at start-ups. It's certainly not meant for market leaders, "who tend to play safe."
			Suman Srivastava
			Speaking of start-ups, what does Suman think about the VC money the current lot is said to be notoriously squandering? Does he think they're wasting money on mass media? "Absolutely. Unequivocal yes," he answers, adding, "I'm worried about entrepreneurs who're already thinking about the exit strategy, the ones who're only focussed on valuation... there's mania around valuation..."
			Should e-commerce and other digital brands, that belong to a segment driven by discounts, even bother chasing brand loyalty, an arguably elusive concept today? "Yes, they should. After all, we are creatures of habit. We like the expected. We like routine," he fields, insisting that price is not the only carrot. There are aspects like convenience, familiarity and brand experience that loyalty can be built on the back of.
			Is this book a way to pitch for brands that belong to new age, young categories, for example mobile wallets, dot coms, etc.? In his view, it is brands - not categories - that are new age, or not. "I'm pitching for brands that want to re-invent, re-innovate," he admits.
			While he advocates brands owning a purpose, he cautions, "It doesn't have to be a 'social' purpose. Dove, for instance, is about self esteem. Bournvita is about a new kind of mothering... the Indian tiger mom."
			"The old paradigms of marketing worked for FMCG," adds Suman, citing Tata Salt, Tata Tea, Lifebuoy and Dove as examples of "new age brands in old fashioned categories."
			"There's no way new sectors can stick to classical marketing - marketing that was invented for packaged goods. If they do so, then it's just a money spending racket, which is what the e-commerce guys are doing." By 'new sector' he means "everything that's not FMCG."
			There's a chapter in the book on all things quant. Is he pro or against data mining and market research? "I'm against this whole 'big data will give me insights' belief... the best insights come from very small sample sizes - one and two... I can then verify it with a large amount of data but I can't get the insight because of that. Which means, you have to have a hypothesis. I am against over-reliance on sophisticated research techniques," he clarifies, advocating Google's concept of 'pretotyping', that is, "a quick, easy, dirty way of testing stuff."
			The book has 255 pages and is published by Cinnamon Teal Publishing.

			<h2>The 10 Most-Watched Indian Ads on YouTube in May 2016</h2>

			<p>
			ke every month, we're back with the top 10 Indian ads on YouTube. This month's leaderboard features a healthy mix of brands from different verticals like FMCG, telecom, and technology.Aravinda Holla
			While the brands continued spending a handsome amount to grab the eyeballs of the Indian online consumer, they aren't spending much on creating content that is exclusive for the internet. Most of these ads are just TV commercials uploaded on YouTube.
			Note: While doing the research, one of the interesting observations we noticed was that global tech brands have started targetting the Indian audience on YouTube a lot! For instance, Website builder Wix, video conferencing product GoToMeeting, and the mobile browser UCBrowser were pretty aggressive with their ads on YouTube. But, we're not including them in this list as we're focussing more on Indian brands and their commercials.
